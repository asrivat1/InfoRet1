HW1 by Akshay Srivatsan


Notes on Part 1:
================

This program is to be run through Weka. Upon running hw1a.prl, you will see the file fullstop_data.arff appear. Run this file through Weka using the following options: J48 -C 0.25 -M 2

In my own testing, I got the following results from 10-fold cross validation on the provided training data:
